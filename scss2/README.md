# Utilities

Bootstrap utilites api will generate rules for each entry in `$utilities`. Each of these rules will also contain media-specific variants for each breakpoint in `$grid-breakpoints`

The scripts here will breakup utilities into more modular categories:
- Display
- Flexbox
- Sizing
- Spacing
- Text
- Style

## Diffs - things i'd like to change

- eliminate `!important`
- make use of css custom properties for better extensibility
- stop using `position: relative` in grid

## Display Utilities

## Flexbox Utilities

- flexbox utils were previously in grid

## Sizing Utilities

## Spacing Utilities

## Text Utilities

## Style Utilities
